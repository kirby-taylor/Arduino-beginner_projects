# Arduino Projects Book â€“ Visual Demonstrations

Welcome! This repository showcases the hands-on projects completed while working through the **Arduino Projects Book** (included in the official Arduino Starter Kit).

The projects presented here are **not original creations**. They are based entirely on the tutorials and exercises provided in the Arduino Projects Book. My goal is to **visually document and share my learning progress** as I explore and build each project.

Whether you're also learning Arduino or just curious, feel free to browse through the examples and code.

## Disclaimer

I do not claim ownership of the projects, circuits, or concepts shown here. All credit goes to the original authors and creators of the **Arduino Projects Book**.

This repository exists for educational and demonstrative purposes only. This is an ongoing effort, and projects will be uploaded as they are completed.

## What's Included

Each folder in this repo will contain:
- The Arduino sketch (`.ino` file)
- Pictures or videos of the circuit
- Pictures of the Schematic (LT Spice)

## Connect

If you're also learning Arduino or have tips/suggestions, feel free to open an issue or fork the repo.
